## What

The **Ansible Role Continuous Deployment (CD) Workflow** defines the process of automating, validating, and deploying configuration management components using **Ansible roles**.  

This workflow standardizes how automation tasks are developed, tested, and deployed through continuous integration and deployment pipelines, ensuring consistent and reliable infrastructure provisioning.

---

## Why

Implementing a structured **Ansible Role CD Workflow** ensures reliability, scalability, and traceability of infrastructure changes.  

It helps teams manage automation in a modular way, enabling faster deployments and reduced configuration drift across environments.

### Key Benefits

| **Benefit** | **Description** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Consistency** | Enforces standardized role and task structures. |
| **Automation** | Integrates with CI/CD tools for deployment automation. |
| **Reusability** | Encourages reusable roles for common infrastructure tasks. |
| **Quality Assurance** | Ensures roles are tested and validated before release. |
| **Traceability** | Tracks deployment changes and test results automatically. |

---

## Workflow Overview

The workflow defines a structured sequence from **development to deployment** for Ansible roles.

```

Task (Ansible Implementation)
├── Subtask (Role Creation)
│     ├── Activity (Testing)
│     ├── Activity (Validation)
│     └── Activity (CD Deployment)
└── Acceptance Criteria (Validation and Completion)

````

### Workflow Phases

| **Phase** | **Description** |
|------------|------------------|
| **Planning** | Define automation requirements and identify reusable roles. |
| **Development** | Create or update roles, playbooks, and inventories. |
| **Testing** | Run syntax checks, linting, and test environments (e.g., Molecule). |
| **Deployment (CD)** | Deploy tested roles using CI/CD pipelines. |
| **Verification** | Confirm deployments meet defined acceptance criteria. |
| **Closure** | Document outputs and mark deployment as complete. |

---

## Task Definition

### Objective
A **Task** represents a unit of automation work — typically provisioning, configuration, or orchestration of a service or environment.

### Key Components
- **Playbooks** — Define automation logic and role execution.
- **Variables** — Define environment-specific configurations.
- **Inventory Files** — Maintain target host details.
- **Handlers** — Trigger specific events such as service restarts.

### Example Task
```yaml
- name: Configure NGINX Web Server
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  roles:
    - nginx_role
````

---

## Subtask — Role Structure

Each **Role** represents a modular automation component responsible for a specific functionality. Roles help in organizing reusable configurations and ensuring maintainability.

### Role Directory Structure

```
nginx_role/
├── defaults/
│   └── main.yml
├── files/
│   └── index.html
├── handlers/
│   └── main.yml
├── meta/
│   └── main.yml
├── tasks/
│   └── main.yml
├── templates/
│   └── nginx.conf.j2
├── tests/
│   └── test.yml
└── vars/
    └── main.yml
```

### Role Development Steps

1. Define role purpose and variables.
2. Create **tasks** and **handlers** for configuration management.
3. Add **templates** and **files** for configuration artifacts.
4. Include **tests** for validation.
5. Version control with Git (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`).

---

## Activity — Continuous Deployment (CD)

The **CD activity** automates deployment of Ansible roles through a pipeline integrated with CI/CD tools such as Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.

### CD Workflow Steps

1. **Code Commit** — Push Ansible changes to the repository.
2. **Lint & Syntax Validation** — Run `ansible-lint` and `yamllint`.
3. **Test Execution** — Validate roles using **Molecule** or **Testinfra**.
4. **Build Pipeline** — CI/CD pipeline triggers automated deployment.
5. **Deploy to Environment** — Apply playbooks on target hosts (staging, production).
6. **Post-Deployment Verification** — Run tests or health checks to validate deployment success.
7. **Notification** — Inform team of successful or failed deployment.

### Common Tools

| **Tool**                                 | **Purpose**                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Ansible Tower / AWX**                  | Centralized automation control and scheduling. |
| **Jenkins / GitHub Actions / GitLab CI** | CI/CD orchestration.                           |
| **Molecule**                             | Role testing framework.                        |
| **Yamllint & Ansible-lint**              | Code quality validation.                       |

---

## Acceptance Criteria

Each automation role and CD process must meet specific **acceptance criteria** before being marked complete.

| **Criterion**                | **Description**                                          |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code Validation Passed**   | No lint or syntax errors found.                          |
| **Role Tested Successfully** | Molecule or Testinfra tests executed without failure.    |
| **Deployment Verified**      | Role executed correctly on the target environment.       |
| **Version Tagged**           | Role version tagged in Git for traceability.             |
| **Documentation Updated**    | Role README and changelog updated.                       |
| **Rollback Tested**          | Rollback process verified for recovery scenarios.        |
| **Approval Received**        | Deployment confirmed by automation or environment owner. |

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Roles Modular** — One role should handle a single responsibility.
2. **Use Variables Wisely** — Parameterize configurations for flexibility.
3. **Implement Idempotency** — Ensure tasks don’t cause unintended changes.
4. **Enforce Version Control** — Tag role releases for consistency.
5. **Use Molecule for Testing** — Automate validation for every role update.
6. **Integrate Security Scanning** — Validate credentials, secrets, and permissions.
7. **Automate Documentation Updates** — Sync README and changelog updates with deployments.

---

## FAQs

**1. What is the purpose of separating roles in Ansible?**
To make automation reusable, modular, and easy to maintain across multiple environments.

**2. How can I test roles locally before deploying?**
Use **Molecule** with Docker or Vagrant to simulate environments.

**3. How does CI/CD fit into Ansible automation?**
It automates testing and deployment of roles after code commits.

**4. What happens if deployment fails?**
Rollback scripts or Ansible handlers restore the previous working state.
